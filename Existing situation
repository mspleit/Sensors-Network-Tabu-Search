It deals with a network of stations, which monitor the radioactivity in the air, and send an alert if this radioactivity 
is above a certain threshold. This network has existed in France since 1991 ; its name is TELERAY, and it is operated by
the French Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire (IRSN).

See http://www.irsn.fr/FR/connaissances/Environnement/Pages/Home.aspx (in French).

Similar networks exist in Germany and in other countries.
As one sees, the existing network obeys a simple logic: 
the old stations were concentrated near the nuclear plants; the new ones are put in each French "département" 
(an admi-nistrative division), near the main city of this "département" (France, mainland, is divi-ded into 96 "départements").
