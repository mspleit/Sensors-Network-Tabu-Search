We will not look at the TELERAY network any longer; we will instead consider a simpli-fied territory
(about the same size as France, but much simpler in geometry), try to list the threats, and try to come up with a solution:
where should the sensors be ?

1. Basic data
The basic data are:
Domain : a square of 750 km x 750 km, that is 562 500 km2 (continental France has an
area of 550 000 km2). The coordinates will be from 1 to 750 on the x axis, from 1 to 750
on the y axis. Each square kilometer will be considered as a "pixel".

We have 20 nuclear plants, the coordinates of which are:

X coord 295 490 694 11 662 473 668 422 361 409
Y coord 655 704 699 15 329 433 480 177 262 442
X coord 92 633 60 345 265 294 508 281 438 505
Y coord 565 34 195 452 651 196 129 461 737 53

2. The threats

  1. Each nuclear plant is considered as a possible danger, so we have to put one sensor
  in the same pixel. This is just a precaution, because the nuclear plants are
  closely monitored, permanently, by EDF, the French electricity.

  2. The second threat is as follows: we worry about a possible "cloud of radioactivity",
  coming from the East, because there might be some nuclear accident in a country
  situated East of France. So we want to put a certain number of sensors on our
  Eastern boarder (which represents 750 pixels).

  3. Finally, we have a "diffuse" threat, saying that there might be a terrorist attack
  anywhere on our territory: a kind of "dirty bomb", which releases radionuclides in
  the environment, but is not a nuclear bomb. This kind of bomb causes very little
  damage, but people overreact to such a threat.
  
3. Probabilities and costs of accidents
For a nuclear plant, the probability of a radioactive leak in the atmosphere is estimated
at 5 5 10  per year, for each plant. All plants may reasonably considered as independent.
The estimated cost of an accident is 9 10 Euros.

The probability of an accident in some Eastern country, which would affect our eastern
border is estimated at 4 10 per year. We do not know where the accident would happen
and what point of our border would be affected. The estimated cost is 5 10 Euros.

The probability of a terrorist action, concerning any particular pixel is 5 10 per year, for
the whole country, to be converted to any pixel. The estimated cost is 6 10 Euros.
Of course, all probabilities and costs are rough estimates.

Information about radioactive clouds

We will admit that a radioactive cloud takes the shape of a disk ; the influence of the
winds on this shape is neglected. If the cloud originates from a nuclear plant or from a
terrorist attack (threats 1 and 3), it starts with a very small disk, which expands ; in the
case of a cloud coming from the East (threat 2), the size of the cloud when it enters
France is unknown. In all cases, the speed and direction of winds (therefore the speed
and direction of movement for the cloud) are unknown.

4. Information about sensors

We have 400 sensors to be installed; they can be installed in any particular pixel. Each
sensor detects only locally: it detects the cloud only if the cloud touches the sensor.

Each sensor acts with a 0 or 1 rule: either it says nothing, or it says "1", which means
"alert". Each sensor works continuously, but, in order to simplify matters, we will admit
that it sends its signal each hour.

The probability that a given sensor does not work at all is 6 10 per year, for each sensor ;
all sensors are assumed to be independent, and independent of the accidents. Since the
accidents have themselves a very low probability, we see that the probability that a sensor
misses something which really exists is extremely low, to be neglected in practice.

A false alarm occurs when a sensor sends "1" when there is nothing: we admit that this
is the case on average twice a year, for each sensor.

5. Benefits

Of course, a sensor network does not prevent an accident, but it can diminish its consequences,
since the populations receive an alert.

We admit the following :
– For a nuclear accident in a plant, if the sensor works correctly, the benefit might be
to save one half of the estimated cost, that is 9 0.510 Euros.
– For an accident detected on the East border, the benefit might be one tenth of the
estimated cost, that is 4 10 Euros.
– For a terrorist attack at any point, since it would allow the evacuation from this
point, the benefit might be two thirds of the estimated cost, that is 6 0.6610 Euros.

6. Costs of the network

First, there is a constant maintenance cost, evaluated to 3 510 Euros per year and per
sensor.

Next, there is "false alarm cost" : if a sensor gives an alert which does not correspond to
any reality, the cost is estimated to 5 10 Euros (corresponding to the mobilisation of resources,
such as police and specific services, psychological impact upon population, technicians'
visits to replace the sensor, and so on).

One should distinguish carefully between malfunction and false alarm :
  - If a sensor is isolated and gives an alert, this alert is always taken seriously, so it
    may lead to a false alarm ;
  - On the other hand, if a sensor is close enough to another sensor, and if both give different
    indications, the authorities will be suspicious and check before giving the
    alert. The cost of a false alarm which has been detected soon enough is only 3 10 Euros.
