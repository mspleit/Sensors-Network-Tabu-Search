# Sensors-Network-Tabu-Search
Tabu search algorithm to optimize the placement of a network of 800 radioactivity sensors in a territory consisting of a 750x750 grid in order to maximize the benefit of the network in terms of the detection of various possible threats.

This project placed 1st in the 2016/2017 competition "False Alarms in a Sensor Network" 
by the Society for Mathematical Calculation and French Federation of Mathematical Games.
